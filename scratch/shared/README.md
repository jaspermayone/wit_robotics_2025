# Shared Scratch Files

This folder is tracked by git - perfect for work-in-progress code you want to share with teammates or back up.

Use this for:
- Experimental code you want feedback on
- Quick prototypes to show others
- Test results to share
- Code that's too rough for the main codebase but worth sharing

Once things are polished, move them to the appropriate package directory!
