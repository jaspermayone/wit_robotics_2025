# Scratch Directory

This is your playground for work-in-progress files, experiments, and random code.

## Structure

- **`scratch/` (root)** - Private files, not tracked by git
- **`scratch/shared/`** - Shared files that ARE tracked by git

## Usage

Most files here are ignored by git, so feel free to:
- Test ideas
- Save snippets
- Prototype features
- Store temporary scripts
- Keep notes and calculations

**Want to share something?** Just move it to `scratch/shared/` and it'll be included in git commits. This is perfect for:
- Showing teammates a work-in-progress
- Backing up code you're not ready to polish yet
- Sharing experimental results

Think of this as your workbench - messy is fine!
