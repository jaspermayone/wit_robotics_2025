# Experiments

Place experimental scripts here - things you're testing out but aren't ready to integrate into the main codebase.

Examples:
- Testing new sensor calibration algorithms
- Motor tuning scripts
- Data logging utilities
- Hardware debugging tools
- Performance profiling

Once an experiment proves useful, move it into the appropriate package directory or turn it into a proper utility.
